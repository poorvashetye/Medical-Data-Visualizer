# Medical-Data-Visualizer
This project visualizes medical data using Python libraries like Matplotlib, NumPy, Pandas, and Seaborn.

## Description
The project reads medical examination data from a CSV file and performs the following tasks:
1. Adds an 'overweight' column to indicate whether a person is overweight based on their weight and height.
2. Normalizes data for 'cholesterol' and 'gluc' columns to make 0 always good and 1 always bad.
3. Draws categorical plots and heatmaps to visualize the data.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- NumPy
